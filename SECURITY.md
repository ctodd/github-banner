# 🛡️ Security Assessment for GitHub Activity Banner

## 📋 Overview
This document outlines the security assessment conducted for the GitHub Activity Banner project and details the security improvements implemented.

## 🔍 Security Concerns Identified

1. **Command Execution Risk**
   - The code uses `execSync` from Node.js child_process module to execute git commands without proper input sanitization
   - User-provided version strings are used directly in commit messages and commands

2. **No Input Sanitization for File Paths**
   - The code doesn't explicitly sanitize file paths, which could potentially lead to path traversal issues

3. **Force Push Recommendation**
   - The tool recommends using `git push -f` which can be destructive to remote repositories

4. **No Rate Limiting**
   - The tool creates many commits in batches, which could trigger GitHub's abuse detection mechanisms

5. **Dependency Security**
   - The package.json specifies @octokit/rest version ^19.0.0, but doesn't lock to specific versions
   - No evidence of dependency scanning or vulnerability checking

## ✅ Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Input Sanitization for User-Provided Strings
Added sanitization for user-provided version strings to prevent command injection attacks.

```javascript
// Added sanitizeInput function to prevent command injection
function sanitizeInput(input) {
  // Remove any potentially dangerous characters
  return input.replace(/[;&|`$(){}]/g, '');
}

// Applied sanitization to user input
this.version = sanitizeInput(version.toUpperCase());
```

### 2. Explicit Path Normalization
Implemented proper path normalization to prevent path traversal attacks.

```javascript
// Normalize and resolve paths before use
const safePath = path.normalize(path.resolve(repoPath));
// Then use safePath instead of repoPath
```

### 3. Secure Command Execution
Replaced unsafe `execSync` calls with a more secure command execution pattern using `spawn`.

```javascript
// Using spawn instead of execSync for better security
const { spawn } = require('child_process');

function executeCommand(command, args, options = {}) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const proc = spawn(command, args, { stdio: 'pipe', ...options });
    
    let stdout = '';
    let stderr = '';
    
    proc.stdout.on('data', (data) => {
      stdout += data.toString();
    });
    
    proc.stderr.on('data', (data) => {
      stderr += data.toString();
    });
    
    proc.on('close', (code) => {
      if (code === 0) {
        resolve(stdout);
      } else {
        reject(new Error(`Command failed with code ${code}: ${stderr}`));
      }
    });
    
    proc.on('error', (err) => {
      reject(err);
    });
  });
}
```

## 🚫 Recommendations Not Implemented (And Why)

### 1. Force Push Warnings
**Why not implemented:** Force pushing is an intentional part of this tool's design. The branch-based approach requires force pushing to create clean branches with specific commit histories. This is essential for creating the activity patterns.

### 2. Rate Limiting
**Why not implemented:** The batch processing approach is necessary to create the visual patterns in the GitHub activity graph. The tool already creates commits in batches to improve efficiency while minimizing GitHub API load.

### 3. Dependency Locking
**Why not implemented:** This project has minimal dependencies and is designed for short-term use rather than long-term maintenance. Users are encouraged to review dependencies before use.

### 4. HTTPS for Git Remote
**Why not implemented:** The tool works with whatever remote URL the user has configured. It doesn't enforce HTTPS as users may have legitimate reasons to use SSH for authentication.

## 🔒 Conclusion
The implemented security improvements significantly reduce the risk of command injection and path traversal attacks. The project now handles user input more securely and executes commands in a safer manner. Some standard security recommendations were intentionally not implemented as they would interfere with the core functionality of creating GitHub activity patterns.
